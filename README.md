# BlazorRDLCViewerWebAssembly

### Demonstrates loading a RDLC report into Microsoft Blazor WebAssembly

Read the Blog post: [Develop and Display RDLC Reports in Microsoft Blazor](https://blazorhelpwebsite.com/ViewBlogPost/20070)

There is a Blazor Server version here: [https://github.com/ADefWebserver/BlazorRDLCViewer](https://github.com/ADefWebserver/BlazorRDLCViewer)

This is made possible primarily by the functionally provided by these two projects:

* [Report Viewer Core](https://github.com/lkosson/reportviewercore)
* [PdfJs](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js?tab=readme-ov-file)
